Something that I always had an interest in, is openshift. At `$lastCorporateJob`, one of the things that I did as a proof of concept was deploy OpenShift 3.10. That was a *long* time ago. And since then, I haven't touched it since.

In between working on Rocky Linux and other open source side projects, I like to play with stuff. In this particular instance, I was debating between a FreeIPA plugin I wanted to finish or finally setting up that okd cluster. I did the latter.

## OKD on libvirt... Why? What's wrong with you?

I ask myself that every day. Honestly, it was more for the challenge. I currently have a single EL8 machine that runs my VM's as well as acts as my router. I've done this for a very long time. This machine is a 8-core Xeon system with about 128GB of RAM, and plenty of storage to play around with.

## The Setup

The current specs on my lab machine are as followed:

* Xeon 8-core (HT)
* 128GB RAM
* 8TB RAID10 Storage

I have plenty of VLAN's running around, so I choose my `10.100.1.0` network.

This was enough for what I needed. As for the VM's, I specced them out like this:

| Name | Type | OS  | CPU | RAM | Storage | IP  |
| ---  | ---  | --- | --- | --- | ---     | --- |
| okd-bootstrap | bootstrap | Fedora CoreOS | 4 | 16 | 120GB | 10.100.1.150 |
